abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera.},

abstract = {Innovations of technology can change the way humans interact with their world. The demand for robotic technology is not exclusively influenced by the component specifications of what a robot is built of, but instead driven by the applications and potential of a robot. Humanoid robots are the best interface for human and robotic interaction because they are ergonomically designed to physically mimic a person thereby benefiting mankind by having the potential to physically operate in an environment designed for society. Moreover, humans are more apt to treat humanoid robots as companions because humans are more likely to project a personality onto the robot. This paper attempts to explore two topics: the advantages of entertainment based applications for humanoids as a vehicle for role-based game playing, and exploring the model for humanoid interaction with either a human adversary or a humanoid adversary. This paper also mentions entertainment based application implementations on systems with limited resources. We utilized the DARwIn-OP as a vehicle to demonstrate a fundamental application of basic artificial intelligence. In playing the role-based game of tic-tac-toe, we created a model for human to humanoid robot interaction as well as humanoid robot to humanoid robot interaction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {New vision sensors, such as the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision sensor (DAVIS), incorporate a conventional global-shutter camera and an event-based sensor in the same pixel array. These sensors have great potential for high-speed robotics and computer vision because they allow us to combine the benefits of conventional cameras with those of event-based sensors: low latency, high temporal resolution, and very high dynamic range. However, new algorithms are required to exploit the sensor characteristics and cope with its unconventional output, which consists of a stream of asynchronous brightness changes (called "events") and synchronous grayscale frames. For this purpose, we present and release a collection of datasets captured with a DAVIS in a variety of synthetic and real environments, which we hope will motivate research on new algorithms for high-speed and high-dynamic-range robotics and computer-vision applications. In addition to global-shutter intensity images and asynchronous events, we provide inertial measurements and ground-truth camera poses from a motion-capture system. The latter allows comparing the pose accuracy of ego-motion estimation algorithms quantitatively. All the data are released both as standard text files and binary files (i.e., rosbag). This paper provides an overview of the available data and describes a simulator that we release open-source to create synthetic event-camera data.},

@article{Temeltas2006,
abstract = {In this study, a new approach in Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) is introduced as an education tool in robotics, mechatronics and control. The paper discusses the development and utilization of HILS specifically in the instruction of control and design aspects of on-site and remote robotics courses. A HIL simulator differs from computer simulation as it involves actual hardware and is not limited with the software representation of the system. The HIL architecture proposed in this study is a novel contribution to robotics education and is different from previous HIL structures for robotics, in that the developed test-bed involves the actual joint actuator and can be programmed to reflect actual dynamics affecting that particular joint in the given robotic structure. Two motors driven by high performance DSP boards are used for this purpose; one representing the joint actuator and the other used for the generation of all the torque components affecting that joint for the robot system in consideration. Thus, it is possible to evaluate the overall performance of the robot and its end-effector by combining the data from each simulated jointassociated dynamics pair. The wide range of kinematic configurations thus offered by the simple structure of HILS makes them an attractive, cost-effective solution for the problem of limited repertoire in robotics labs, giving the students the opportunity to experiment with 'open architecture robots' that are essential for a thorough education in robot control, but on the other hand are quite rare and may not be available in an average lab environment. Additionally, similar to its use in the robotics lab applications presented in this study, HILS can provide a comprehensive test environment prior to the implementation of new control strategies on the actual system, thereby ensuring the safe use and longevity of high-cost robots in on-site/remote labs. The proposed HIL architecture is combined with a client/server software configuration to allow students access to the test-bed. The results obtained from the remote control of a two-degres-of-freedom planar arm presented as a case study have motivated the utilization of the system as an efficient education and research tool for on-site and remote robotics laboratories. {\textcopyright} 2006 TEMPUS Publications.},

Those courses provide students with knowledge and skill in multiple aspects of the design, simulation, implementation and operation of systems using robotics technologies for applications in areas such as the industrial, medical, services, among others. This work describes the implementation and application of a Matlab-based platform using low-cost technologies as an educational tool to be included in robotics courses. The platform comprises an Arduino as a target for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation using Matlab and a 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) articulated robotic arm. The HIL simulation system differs from computer simulation in such a way that it involves actual hardware and permits controlling the real world actuators and sensors. It was carried out set of experiments aimed to evaluate the platform in the field of human-robot interaction; specifically, through an application to control the robotic arm to follow movements of a human upper limb. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to correlate movement provided by user and the actual movement executed by the robotic arm. Obtained mean measurement errors were RMSE of 4.7� for static validation and 5.3� for dynamic tests.},

It is argued that it is most important for the understanding of the students to perform the first step whereas the actual implementation in a programming language is of secondary importance for the learning of problem-solving techniques. We therefore suggest to chose a well-structured teaching language that provides a clear and intuitive syntax and allows students to quickly express their algorithms. In our experience in engineering computing we find that MATLAB is much better suited than C for this task but the best choice in terms of clarity and functionality of the language is provided by Python.},
