\begin_layout Title
A MATLAB/ROS System for SLAM Algorithm Education
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Andrew Willis, David Grabowsky, Nelyadi Samyak Shetty, James Conrad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This article describes a complete platform the leverages the Robot Operating
 System and MATLAB software to provide a novel environment for SLAM algorithm
 development, simulation, prototyping and education.
 The system enables users to validate and evaluate SLAM algorithms written
 in MATLAB using conventional numerical simulation, hardware-in-the-loop
 (HIL) simulation or on real robotic platforms, e.g., the Turlebot Kobuki
 from iCreate, with little to no modification to the MATLAB SLAM code.
 As such, the system represents an important tool for the purpose of prototyping
 and benchmarking SLAM algorithms and also serves as an ideal platform for
 educating students on the theory and practical implementation of SLAM algorithm
s.
 This article describes the structure of the system and describes how the
 system provides heretofore inaccessible levels of educational benefits
 for SLAM algorithm education.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a classical topic in the
 robotic, navigation, guidance and computer vision community.
 Solutions to this problem seek to exploit geometric sensor measurements
 to simultaneously create a map of the environment around the robot and
 estimate the position the robot within this map.
 (GUIDE)

\begin_layout Standard
In academia the usefulness of a robust simulation tool cannot be understated.
 The ability to rapidly prototype and evaluate the effectiveness of methods
 and algorithms is of paramount importance to both the classroom and research
 setting.
 With research, developing an efficient tool for simulation can be a time
 consuming and costly process that provides no contribution to the research
 other than test validation.
 Test validation is of course extremely important, but the development of
 a system for such validation is often not the goal of said research.
 In addition, the code used for simulation is often not efficiently saleable
 or capable of being modified in such a way that it can be rapidly re-purposed
 for real world experimentation.
 A popular option for mitigating the time requried for simulation is to
 use pre made data sets.
 Data sets consist of data, such a range measurments or image frames, that
 can be processed without the need for a simulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, these data-sets are constrained by the by the very fact that they
 are a finate set of data and thus the risk of creating an algorithm that
 is 'fine tunned' for the data set becomes plausable.
 The largest constraint in classroom education is time.
 The typical length of a semester for college on most academic calendars
 in the United States is fifteen weeks long.
 Fifteen weeks is an extremely short amount of time to create a simulation
 software to validate methods especially when the focus of a class is not
 on the creation of simulation software but rather gaining a thorough understand
ing of the methods being used and validating them with said simulation.
 This holds especially true with Systematic Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
 SLAM is an broad field covering a variety of topics in robotics such as
 navigation, guidance and computer vision.
 Any course planning to cover SLAM will already be hard pressed to thoroughly
 explain the formulation behind the methods used in solution, such as kalman
 filtering, data ascoication, image processing etc.
 However, only explaining the formulation behind methods is unsatisfactory.
 Students should be tested on thier ability to understand these methods
 through implementation, simluation, and experimentation.
 The problem is, there is simply not enough time to fully develope the software
 needed to do such simluation in the given the time frame.
 Depending on the enviorment used to create said simluation, such as C,
 the time required could increase by a large factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the usefullness for a platform that allows for SLAM algorithm development,
 simluation, prototyping, and education can be seen.
 MATLAB offers a prime envoirment for the devleopment of such a platform

 MATLAB is a high level lagnauge that can be rapidly understood by anyone
 with a small coding background.
 MATLAB allows for the creation of algorithms in less lines of codes as
 it capable of abstracting many of the otherwise complex function that one
 would see present in low level languages like C

 (EXAMPLES, CITATIONS, EXPLAIN).
 One of the largest benifits of MATLAB is the ease of understanding and
 modification it provides.
 In addtiion the layout of the MATLAB code allows students to easily see
 the relationship between the thoery/formulation discussed in class and
 the algorithms being implemented in code.

publisher/subscriber interface MATLAB is able to receive sensor measurments
 and send control commands.
 The ROS publisher/subscriber interface works in such a manner that only
 a netowrk communciation link between the sensor/robot and MATLAB host is
 required.
 This is extremely important as it allows for simulation and physical experiment
ation to be switched between extremly efficently as the algorithms used
 can remaing largley untouched while only the target of the communication
 must change.

In many cases, the most effective way to develop robotic automation in industrie
s is to integrate the robot into the real process of application.
 A HIL simulator differs from computer simulation as it involves actual
 hardware and is not limited with the software representation of the system.
 In other cases, HIL simulation is more efficient as the students can study
 the behavior of the developed robot the context of the entire application.
 Due to the value it offers both in manufacturing and education, HIL systems
 have found a wide range of applications in aircraft and missile industries[12,
 13], automotive industry [14, 15], motion control, mechatronics [16±20]
 and finally in the field of robotics; Reported applications of the HIL
 concept in robotics is given in [21, 22], in which the HIL approach is
 used with the incorporation of the actual motion controller into the simulation
 process of a robot arm.
 However, the contribution has been limited to the use of one piece of actual
 hardware, which is the DSP-based controller used in the generation of the
 computer simulation software

\begin_layout Standard
The duration of development and testing affects the time as it might be
 revelant in a educational setting for higher level algorithms.
 HIL cannot easily stop-if you pause the hardware-in-the-loop simulator,
 all the components that it's attached to, including the algorithm in your
 system-under-test, keep running.
 We could, of course, put breakpoints or a pause-on-command feature in our
 simulation but that's rather intrusive.
 In addition , labs in giving access to actual experimentation are ultimately
 more effective for the goals of a more hands-on education and research.The
 development of actual robots to implement these algorithms might have have
 practical industry applications but the time and effort put into developing
 low level code and the physical hardware might be unnecessary when used
 in a educational setting.
 In addition to this different algorithms might require different hardware
 such as sensors to implement the application.
 For example visual base SLAM might require a depth based camera while other
 versions of the algoihm might require just a laser scaaner.
 However, due to the employment of actual robots and equipment, labs in
 this category ,whether on site or remote, are expensive to set-up, maintain
 and provide with long hours of daily staffing.
 Safety and longevity issues of these costly instruments arise as other
 important points of consideration, particularly when open access is allowed
 to users of a multitude of education, back groundand experience levels.

In the context of education, implementing a SLAM algorithm can be broken
 into two broad problems.
 The first is understanding the algorithm and how it is a solution to the
 SLAM problem.
 The second is implementing that algorithm with code.
 The puspose of most classes is to focus on the first of these problems
 which is understanding how an algorithm solves the SLAM problem.
 The implementation of said algorithms mainly focuses around translating
 the solution equation into an coded algorithm and then being able to observe,
 via simulation or experimnetation, the validity of these solutions.
 Therefore, a coding language must be chosen that allows for easy translation
 between equation and algorithm.
 One of the most popular language options is C, or C++.
 C is a low level programing language that is known for its ability to provide
 execution speed and efficency, espcially for embedded systems where avaiable
 resources are a large constraint.
 However, the cost of this is the knowledge and complexity which is required
 to encode algorithms.
 MATLAB is a high level programming lanugage, sometimes called a 4th generation
 language.
 One of the main differences between MATLAB and C is the fact that MATLAB
 reads the source code line by line and interperts it into machine instructions
 on the fly, meaning no compilation is required.
 This results in decreased execution speed but has the major benifit of
 freeing the programmer from needing to worry about memory alocation and
 allows for dynamic typing

.
 In short, MATLAB allows for algorithms to be encoded much quicker and with
 less lines of code then in C at the cost of execution speed

 proposes how MATLAB can be used as a simulation tool for classical control
 anyalsis/design and model predictive control.
 The paper discusses how when teaching controls the set of paper and pencil
 examples is quite limited as any non-trival system design and anaylsis
 will require fairly complex Bode and Nyquist plots, among other things,
 which can not be well represented by hand drawn sketeches.
 MATLAB allows for the systems to be quickly coded and experimented with.
 Any experimentation done via paper and pencil could take minutes to fully
 compute, MATLAB instead takes seconds.
 In addition, it allows for concepts such as root-loci to be first attempted
 by hand then incrementaly validated via MATLAB.
 This provides a level of interaction that is impossible in traditional
 settings as the student is able to activley reforce thier learning through
 simulation.
 Also, the time and coding knowledge required to code the solutions for
 the controls problems presented in the paper is minimum.
 The figure below shows how a system G(s) and controller K(s) can be quickly
 coded and simulated to examine steady state values.
 The speed and ease with which this can be acomplished makes it an invauable
 tool to aid students in learning the finer points of concepts presented
 throughout the class.

The Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In simulation, MATLAB is used to construct a map whose geometry is known
 in both MATLAB and in the simulator, e.g., Gazebo.
 Gazebo is a slave to MATLAB for the purpose of creating the map.
 Here a MATLAB class is responsible for constructing the world by instantiating
 objects (in the form of 3D models) into the Gazebo world.
 These objects are also placed in a 3D world tracked by MATLAB.

Data Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Give examples of how image data and scan data flow from the data generator
 to MATLAB.
 MATLAB takes in the data and generates observation measurements for the
 SLAM algorithm.
 The algorithm then takes these measurements in and updates/corrects the
 state which includes the robot's localized position and the MAP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key aspect of any simulator or experimention software is data flow.
 In fact data flow is a critical issue for the SLAM simulator as it provides
 the link between any type of sensor measurment and controls.
